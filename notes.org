#+TITLE: Notes

* Behavior
** Basics
GNU nm lists the symbols from object files objfile.
For each symbol, nm shows:

- â€¢ The symbol value, in the radix selected by options (see below), or hexadecimal by default.

- â€¢ The symbol type. At least the following types are used; others are, as well, depending on the object file format. If lowercase, the symbol is local; if uppercase, the symbol is global (external).

** Symbols
- "A" = The symbol value is absolute, and will not be changed by further linking

- "B" or "b" = The symbol is in the ununitialized data sections (known as BSS).

- "C" = The symbol is common. Common symbols are uninitialized data. When linking, multiple common symbols may appear with the same name. If the symbol is defined anywhere, the common symbols are treated as undefined references.

- "D" or "d" = The symbol is in the initialized section

* Exceptions
- If no object files are listed as arguments, nm assumes the file a.out.
